I prefer http://nmap.org/[Nmap Security Scanner] to verify SSLv3 Poodle vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566), the command is very simple:

----
nmap -p 443 --script +ssl-enum-ciphers YOUR.SERVER.ADDRESS.COM
----
    
Sample result:

<1> SSLv3 is not supported, we are safe!

[NOTE]
====

OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol downgrade. Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566). See also https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00 and https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf
